## Welcome

Hey there! I'm Owais, a software engineer with roots in New England and Austin, TX.
Right now I'm building some of the projects at my company [Stormlight Labs](https://stormlightlabs.org).
I'm enrolled as a master's candidate at the University of Texas, and was most
recently working as a senior backend engineer at [Edlink](https://ed.link/).

## Mission

The purpose of this site is for me to give back to the software engineering and
computer science communities. There are a lot of tools, information, and
resources out there, many of them freely available. They've been paramount to my
transition from the natural sciences in to engineering (I double majored in
microbiology and biochemistry). As I've been learning new technologies and concepts,
I've taken a lot of notes and would like to [share](https://desertthunder.dev/garden/) publicly.
I also want to try my hand at writing essays to help break down complex topics.
