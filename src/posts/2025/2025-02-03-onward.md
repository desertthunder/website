I totally dropped the ball on this one. I wrote the draft with just the title
and thought I'd make a silly joke about that pixar movie. Instead I spent a
lot of time today struggling through my GUI application project. There's
something to be said about starting with a simple idea and then treating
the project like a creative work[^1]. This project definitely is not there. It's
meant to be yet another zettlekasten note taker, but with asciidoc (tables in
asciidoc are amazing[^2] and you can easily write books with it).

Today was an odd day. I did take notes on the Rust book. I feel as though I've
read the [ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html)
chapter a million times all while avoiding the trait and lifetime chapters.

Eventually I'd like to add [giscus](https://giscus.app/) to my blog. The
integration with Github discussions is pretty cool. This post is very rambly
and I'm not sure what I'm trying to say. Here's hoping I can share some of my
`.plan` files soon, either here or at [stormlight](https://stormlightlabs.org).

Thanks for reading.
