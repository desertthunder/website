Is it trite to watch a movie called Groundhog's day today?

Today has been a really...odd day. I didn't accomplish much of anything. At
least, it feels like I haven't. That is fundamentally untrue though[^1]. I spent
a lot of time in plaintext files because I started the migration of my digital
[garden](https://desertthunder.github.io/garden) to Starlight from mkdocs. The
true advantage I see to it is that it feels like I can extend it more easily
than mkdocs (with material). Instead of installing a new plugin, adding a custom
element is as simple as writing a new Astro component (or [island](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/)), changing the file from markdown to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
and importing it. I suppose it would be hard to beat the Python docstring plugin, but
accessing, parsing, then rendering your docs isn't too complicated[^2]. A JavaScript
toolchain is already a bit of a collossal web of interconnected dependencies and
I prefer this method to installing a new plugin. I'm increasingly trying to do things
by hand at least once. It helps you appreciate that thought, care, and work that
library and frameworks put into their work.

I'm building a note taking application with some of the features I want (and rust 🚀),
like the book writing capabilities of [Typst](https://typst.app/) or [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/), and my dad decided to look up the ecosystem. I pointed to [logseq](https://logseq.com/) as a cool example of what I'd like to build and after viewing them he said the best thing[^3]: "why am I still using a word doc as a journal?"

[^1]: Look at my code stats [page](https://codestats.net/users/desertthunder)!
[^2]: Seriously. I mean, this grug brained dev did [it](https://github.com/desertthunder/sonotabula/blob/main/cli/docs.py)
[^3]: Both of my parents are occasionally very hilarious.
