My company uses two languages right now: Dart & Rust. Dart with Flutter for
mobile applications and Rust for command-line and GUI applications.

Rust is harder than Dart & Flutter.

The *dx* for Flutter is fantastic. I really appreciate the hot reload and ability
to easily test my application on two platforms.

Dart is a fun and flexible language.

Flutter's material widgets take a lot of the overhead out of the process of
writing client side code.

Learning React was similar for me. I started learning modern web development in
earnest after I felt that I had a firm grasp of JavaScript. State machine patterns
were brand new and difficult to wrap my head around. "UI as a function of state[^1]"
is the key pattern that was being discussed and taught as the ecosystem moved
away from lifecycle methods into hooks.

Dart shares a lot with similar domain languages like ES5 JavaScript and Java.

Designing an application and mapping out the state is challenging. Elm usage of
messages[^2] to describe the way an action (sort of like redux action types[^3])
mutates state is great for building mental models.

Iced uses the Elm architecture.

Where I struggle with Rust is conceptualizing lifetimes (and occasionally mixing
up `str` and `String`).

*How can I best describe a lifetime?*

*Borrowing?*

*Why am I using flutter?*

Finishing projects is hard. Here's another shout out to Blake Watson. He wrote
a post giving tips on how to do so.
