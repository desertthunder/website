I'm **Owais J.**, a software engineer & writer with a passion for learning.

In late 2024 I started [Stormlight Labs](https://stormlightlabs.org), a company focused on open-source tooling and apps that serve the community and help others.

My greatest joy comes from learning and sharing knowledge with others.
