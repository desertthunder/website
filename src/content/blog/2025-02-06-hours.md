It honestly feels like there are not enough hours in the day. I watched a video
by Dreams of Code where [he talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLB7r8neQvE)
about Alpine.js. I can't really remember much about it besides the fact that it
has a very descriptive and accurate title. I have proof too! Today I replaced
my root github page with an [updated](https://desertthunder.github.io/) start
page. This is what I spent my afternoon doing in between looking for jobs. It
was a bit like watching Netflix while studying. Which thing are you *really*
doing? Why? Anytime I attempted to do it was because studying wasn't fun but
How I Met Your Mother hadn't yet ended. Anyways I'll walk through some of the
decisions I made with the first iteration.

## Building a Start Page

Here is a snippet from the main [script](https://github.com/desertthunder/desertthunder.github.io/blob/main/lib/js/index.js) for the page/app:

```js
/**
 * @type {% raw %}{{[category: string]: Array<{name: string, url: string, alt: string, icon?: string}>}}{% endraw %}
 */
const data = {
	Custom: [
		{
			name: "omg.lol",
			url: "https://owais.omg.lol",
			alt: "Owais's Page",
			icon: '<i class="i-ri-heart-2-fill"></i>',
		},
		{
			name: "Blog",
			url: "https://desertthunder.dev",
			alt: "Desert Thunder",
			icon: '<i class="i-ri-newspaper-fill"></i>',
		}
	]
}
```

So here I use JSDoc types because I didn't feel like dealing with TypeScript today.
The point of Alpine is to make interactivity simple, and all I was building was a
web page with a few columns of links (I was inspired by this[^1]) and a pleasing color scheme[^2].
I took this hardcoded array of links and rendered them using the `x-for` directive. An easy way to loop.

The slightly more challenging aspect of interactivity for me was using the `$store`
magic. Basically I wanted the sidebar visibility to be available globally and spent
a long time figuring out why I couldn't get it to work. It was because you define
the initial value of that particular slice with a value, not a function. This,
and the dark mode toggle with a little bit of animation are so common in web apps
nowadays and its nice that you can just whip it up with a few lines of code.

```js
// The sidebar key added to $store
Alpine.store("sidebar", {
	open: false,
	toggle() {
		this.open = !this.open;
	},
});

// links into a component
Alpine.data("links", () => ({
	byCategory: data,
}));
```

The sidebar is polished with a few directives added to the markup:

```html
<aside class="fixed top-0 right-0 h-full w-96 md:w-80 bg-gray-800 text-white z-50 flex flex-col p-4 gap-4"
    x-show="$store.sidebar.open"
    x-transition
    x-transition.scale.origin.right
    x-data>
    <section>Sidebar Content</section>
</aside>
```

The defaults were enough for my purposes. The documentation wisely provides some
tailwind specific[^3] examples. My favorite thing about tailwind is the LSP.
Autocomplete with icon sets is a godsend. Especially with Remix Icon. You can
quickly leverage variants of an icon. Here's how I do hover states with some icons:

```html
<i class="i-ri-spotify-fill hover:i-ri-spotify-line" />
```

Though more often than not, I want colors to change when an icon is in a button
so it'll look like this:

```html
<button class="group whatever-else-you-put-in-a-button">
    <i class="text-gray-50 i-ri-spotify-fill group-hover:text-gray-500" />
</button>
```

If not for the LSP, I'd likely have these saved as snippets. I had a lot of fun
just playing around with markup today.

## Home Cooked Software

This was all inspired by a rabbit hole that Blake sent me on[^4]. I didn't know
what a home cooked app was but I like the sentiment. Cooking is a true labor of
love and I hope I can provide more joy and show love to people with my work. I'm
staring at monospaced fonts all day, may as well bring some warmth to someone's
soul instead of my eye sockets.

Local first software[^5], written extensively about by Martin Kleppman (author of [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://amzn.to/40Lt6aP)), had a talk[^6]
at their Berlin conference last year about Home Cooked Software and the concept
of a barefoot engineers. The central purpose of the talk was to describe the tech
savvy programming adjacent person's new power with tools like v0, ChatGPT, and
[TLDraw](https://www.tldraw.com/). You probably know a person who doesn't code but
builds the coolest spreadsheets and probably sells notion templates on gumroad.
Sometimes they do learn to [code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpUuuT_EzSs) but
maybe they don't have to in order to make cool stuff.

This doesn't *really* pertain to me. I'm not an amazing engineer. I just do it
for the love of the game[^7] and can't use AI autocomplete or AI generated code
without getting upset. Robin Sloan's [notes](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/)
are more in line with how I'd approach this. The key here is really knowing your users.
In his notes, one of them is his mother. As I've worked on my company's projects, the
best feedback I've gotten is from my friends who I know would use my stuff.
I'd like for my relationship with users and my community to be a little like that mixed
with a cult following (the John Green kind). I feel a lot of joy knowing when someone
finds value in my work and it's a high I chase quite relentlessly.

Thanks for reading.
