This has to be the 10 millionth hello world blog post I think I've made in my life.[^1]
Definitely the first of 2025. Instead, this year I've spent a lot of time scaffolding
projects and writing things in Markdown. This feels different though. I found the
eleventy-excellent [starter](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/built-with/) and
just...went for it. My strength isn't true front-end, and the designer of this
one is the real deal. I'm just a backend engineer who likes to write. What really
got me was the fact that it was using [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/).
I think I first saw this on the ROC language [book](https://roc-lang.github.io/book-of-examples/)
of examples. It's no Open Dyslexic[^2] but it is still fantastic for readability
and looks nice.

Building this site has helped me really get started with the indie web, in so much
that I'm signing up for stuff[^3]. I chose violence today so Github Copilot is
auto-suggesting random stuff while I try to write this. It told me about [tilde.club](https://tilde.club).
That seems pretty cool and I quite respect its ethos. Neocities is another cool
one.

I've started a company called [Stormlight Labs](https://stormlightlabs.org). It's
funny how my brain works. It's easy for me to ramble in a markdown file but
making content that's important for my future is difficult. My vision for the
company is for it to be like the development arm[^4] of [Icon Factory](https://iconfactory.com)
mixed with [Charm Bracelet](https://charm.sh)'s penchant for open source tooling.

[^1]: The number of false starts I've had on my [substack](https://desertthunder.substack.com)
is borderline absurd

font out and keep track of your reading speed.
